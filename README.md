This project has demonstrated that an individual control home automation
system can be made inexpensively using low-cost locally available
components and can be used to control a wide range of home appliances,
including security lamps, televisions, air conditioning systems, and even the
entire house lighting system. Even better, the essential components are so
small and few that they may be put in a compact, unobtrusive container.
This system is scalable and adaptable.
